                <p>I'm Richard Young and what makes me want to become a software engineer is developing software and applications that can help others. The feeling of revamping or creating something from scratch to satisfy someone is what pushes me to go further and learn much more. Some of the things I strive to learn from a possible intership with you is mentorship, testing my skills, and learning new technologies.</p>
                <p>Mentorship is important to me, so that i know that i'm being put in the right direction to make clean purposeful code and user interfaces. I want to be of use to a team and hold my own ground next to everyone else.</p>
                <p>Testing my current skills in this internship will allow me to see where I stand in the industry. Using everything I've learned throughout school and self taught courses. With this experience I will know how big or small the gap that I need to fill is.</p>
                <p>The image on the left has meaning to me due to being in that building for hours striving to problem solve class projects. This skill lead me to my first intership where i fell in love with software developement. I was able to create my first web/mobile application that satisfied the company's terms. That feeling of accomplishment is what pushes me to finding a better solution to the problem with the proper technologies.</p>
                <p>I hope to be able to build and be apart of projects in the react framework, incorporate effective usages of API's, and getting more familiar SQL.</p>
